- Accent color: Muted violet (#7E57C2) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif, will be used for all text, since it suits both headlines and body text very well.

- A clean, card-based layout is used to organize information with intuitive navigation for key actions.
- Subtle animations are used to enhance user experience when a chatbot interaction occurs, and when content is loaded.
